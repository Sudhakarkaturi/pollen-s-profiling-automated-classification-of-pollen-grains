# ðŸŒ¼ Pollen's Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains

An end-to-end deep learning project for classifying pollen grains using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deploying it through a Flask web application.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Project Overview

This project uses a CNN model to classify images of pollen grains into 23 botanical classes. It has real-world applications in:

- ðŸŒ¿ **Environmental Monitoring**
- ðŸ¤§ **Allergy Diagnosis**
- ðŸŒ¾ **Agricultural Research**

Users can upload a pollen image through the web interface, and the app predicts the correct class with confidence.
